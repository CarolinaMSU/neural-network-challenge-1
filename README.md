Module 18 Assignment
I wasn't sure when this assignment was due from the system as it did not have a date, so I began to put it together when I saw my classmates discussing it during office hours. It was helpful to see their issues because then it was easier for me to know where I may run into some troubles.
I began like in past assignments, opening my homework and then opening the module 18 class & instructor assignments, I was able to get a large part of the code this way, however when I went to run it in VS I kept running into errors. 
I asked a classmate if he had a similar issue and he reminded me I needed to work on Colab - it has gotten wild remembering all the sites we use!
I was able to run most of my code except a couple of formulas where I had made spelling mistakes. Like insead of saying "Epoch" I typed "enich" and similar issues.
I ran my code in collab then downloaded to view in VS code as I find the Colab tool confusing and I am used to seeing results in VS Code. 
I did struggle with some of the open ended questions at the end as I was unsure if 1 meant loan approved or denied and I didn't quickly find that reference in the assignment so I made an assumption based on previous assignments that a 1 was Yes/Approved and 0 was No.
